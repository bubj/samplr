\title{Single Variable Rejection Sampler}
\usage{
samp1D(fun, a, b, N)
}
\arguments{
\item{fun}{the pdf that we are sampling from, input as a string}

\item{a}{the lower bound on the function f}

\item{b}{the upper bound on the function f}

\item{N}{the number of attempted samples.}
}
\value{
A vector containg the samples form pdf
}
\description{
This function immplents single variable rejection sampling for rvs with bounded support and which have bounded pdf.
